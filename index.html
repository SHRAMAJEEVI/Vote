<h3>Voting in elections is one of the most fundamental organs of any Democracy and in the modern world,</h3> <h3>voting is done through digital machines. In this article, we will try to write a simple Online Voting System using C programming language.</h3>
    <b><u><hr><h2>Features of Online Voting System in C</h2></u></b>
        <h3>The online voting system offers the following functions:</h3>
        
       <h3>1.  Taking a Vote from the User</h3>
        <h3>2. Storing Different Votes</h3>
        <h3>3. Calculating Votes</h3>
       <h3>4.  Declaring Results</h3><br><hr>
      <h1><u> Components of Online Voting System</u></h1>
<h2>The Online Voting System program has the following components:</h2>

<h2>1. Header Files and Macro Definitions</h2>
<h3>This program makes use of only two standard header files <stdio.h> and <string.h>.</h3>
<h3>We have also defined a macro to represent the maximum number of candidates.</h3><hr>
<h2>2. Structure with name "Candidate"</h2>
<h3>The structure with the name "Candidate" is defined to store the information of the candidate. It has the following fields:</h3>

<h3>name Array: This array of characters is used to store the name of the candidate.</h3>
<h3>symbol: This character variable stores the symbol allotted to the candidate.</h3>
<h3>votes: This variable is used to store the number of votes that the given candidate received.</h3><hr>
<h2>3. Data Structures and Variables with Global Scope</h2>
<h3>Some of the data structures and variables are declared inside the global scope to avoid scope problems and make them available to all the functions in the program. These are:

allCandidate[]: This array stores all the candidates.</h3>
<h3>candidateCount: It is used to store the number of candidates.</h3>
<h3>symbol[]: This array is used to store all the symbols.</h3>
<h3>symbolTaken[]: Used to keep track of the symbols that are already allotted to some candidate.</h3><hr>
<h2>4. Functions to Perform Different Tasks</h2>
<h3>Various functions are used in the program to provide modularity to the code. They are named based on the task they are performing:</h3>

<h3>fillCandidate(): This function is used to take user input about the candidate details and store them in the allCandidate[] array.</h3>
<h3>displayAllCandidates(): This function is used to display all available candidates while the voting is being performed.</h3>
<h3>getVotes(): This function is used to take the votes from the user and store them in the structure for the given candidate.</h3>
<h3>getResults(): After the voting, the getResults() function is used to calculate the votes and declare the results of the elections</h3><br><hr>
